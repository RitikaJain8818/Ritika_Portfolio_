                    <p>I am a diligent self starter, continuous learner, avid networker, always seeking opportunities for growth and development and I relish a challenge. One thing I firmly believe in, is that in the midst of all our accomplishments, we should always find ways to give back to the society / community. Being a technology-enthusiast, I love to explore new technologies and leverage it to solve real-life problems. I'm driven by the will to create an impact and encourage diversity and inclusion in communities.
